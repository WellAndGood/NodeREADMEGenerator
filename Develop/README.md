## Description
This application uses Node.js, as well as the Inquirer and FS npm libraries, to collect responses to a series of questions, arranging them into a formatted README.md file for a user's project.  

You run the project by entering `node index.js` in the terminal. You will be given a set of 10 questions, including your Github user name, email, and details about your project including relevant commands and licensing.

Your responses will create a README file titled after your project name (you may change the title after the fact). 

You can find more details on using this application in the [usage](#usage) section.

You will be asked the questions below (answers are fictional):

<pre>npm install</pre>

# Usage
Use the following command to run the program:
<pre>node index.js</pre>

**How to use the application**: [This brief video gives you a walkthorugh of this application](https://youtu.be/3v37d0V2azg)<br>
Otherwise, you will initialize the application by typing `node index.js` into the folder's terminal. Then, answer all ten questions. The README file will be generated and added in the same folder as `index.js`. You may leave some questions blank, though be warned that your README file will be incomplete.
